# Tile Master Helper
This is a Windows Forms application built with .NET Core version 6.0. The purpose of the application is to help users calculate the area or volume of a rectangular object.

The user can select either the area calculation or the volume calculation by checking the corresponding checkbox. If the area calculation is selected, the user can enter the length and width of the object and the application will calculate and display the result in square meters (m²). If the volume calculation is selected, the user can also enter the height of the object, and the application will calculate and display the result in cubic meters (m³).

The application also includes error handling for incorrect input. If the user enters invalid data, an error message will be displayed to alert them.

This application is a demonstration to use .NET Core and Windows Forms to create a simple, functional, and user-friendly application.
